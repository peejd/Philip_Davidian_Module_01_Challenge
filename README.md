# Philip Davidian's Coding Bootcamp Module 01 Challenge


## Description

This webpage represents a refactoring of a pre-existing webpage. 

I was tasked with refactoring it to optimize the page for HTML5 semantics, intuitive code structure and comments, lack of code redundancy, and browser accessibility standards.

This project helped me gain practical experience understanding and implementing the same proficiencies and standards mentioned above.
